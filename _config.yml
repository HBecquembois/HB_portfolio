# 60 Words About the Author
author-about: I finished in June 2023 a 9 week intensive bootcamp in full stack web development at Le Wagon Paris (batch 1210) to start a new life as a web developer. Previous to that I have worked for 20 years in the public sector. My plan is now to work on concrete and meaningful projects. I am concerned by environmental issues and women's rights. <br> <br> I am a very curious person, eager to learn always more. Amongst others, I am passionate about music, gastronomy and reading.
